# Table: gcp_billing_report - Query GCP billing exports

The `gcp_billing_report` table allows you to query detailed cost and usage data exported from Google Cloud Billing to BigQuery. This table provides resource-level breakdowns of GCP service costs, credits, adjustments, and pricing details, enabling cost analysis, budget tracking, and optimization insights across your GCP environment.

## Configure

Create a [partition](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/partition) for `gcp_billing_report`:

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/gcp.tpc
```

```hcl
connection "gcp" "billing_account" {
  project = "my-gcp-project"
}

partition "gcp_billing_report" "my_billing" {
  source "gcp_storage_bucket" {
    connection = connection.gcp.billing_account
    bucket     = "gcp-billing-export-bucket"
    # prefix  = "optional/prefix/"
  }
}
```

## Collect

[Collect](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/collection) billing data for all `gcp_billing_report` partitions:

```sh
tailpipe collect gcp_billing_report
```

Or for a single partition:

```sh
tailpipe collect gcp_billing_report.my_billing
```

## Query

**[See example queries for this table â†’](../gcp_billing_report/queries.md)**

### Example: Monthly cost by service

```sql
select
  invoice_month,
  service_description,
  sum(cost) as total_cost
from
  gcp_billing_report
where
  usage_start_time >= date_sub(current_date(), interval 1 year)
group by
  invoice_month, service_description
order by
  invoice_month, total_cost desc;
```

## Example Configurations

### Collect billing exports from a Storage bucket

```hcl
connection "gcp" "billing_account" {
  project = "my-gcp-project"
}

partition "gcp_billing_report" "my_billing" {
  source "gcp_storage_bucket" {
    connection = connection.gcp.billing_account
    bucket     = "gcp-billing-export-bucket"
    # prefix  = "optional/prefix/"
  }
}
```

### Collect billing exports from an Artifact

```hcl
partition "gcp_billing_report" "my_billing_artifact" {
  source "artifact" {
    path = "/path/to/billing-export.json"
  }
}
```
